# What Should I Do If Someone Infringes on My Intellectual Property Rights?

IP infringement occurs when someone uses your intellectual property without permission. Taking immediate action is crucial to protect your rights.

## Steps to Take

1. **Identify the Infringement**: Gather evidence of the unauthorized use. This can include screenshots, documents, or witness statements.
2. **Cease and Desist Letter**: Send a formal letter demanding the infringement to stop. The letter should clearly state your rights and the consequences of continued infringement.
3. **Legal Action**: File a lawsuit if the infringement continues. This can involve seeking an injunction to stop the infringement and damages to compensate for any losses.
4. **Damages and Compensation**: Seek compensation for the infringement. This can include financial damages, legal fees, and any profits made from the infringement.
