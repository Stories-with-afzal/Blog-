            <section id="overview-of-the-judicial-system">
                <h3>Overview of the Judicial System in Bangladesh</h3>
                <h4>Historical Context</h4>
                <p>The judicial system in Bangladesh has evolved through several historical phases, each contributing to its current structure and functioning. The British colonial era laid the foundation for the legal system, introducing common law principles and establishing the first courts. During this period, the legal framework was designed to maintain order and enforce colonial rule. The establishment of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal in 1862 was a significant milestone, marking the beginning of a structured judicial system.</p>
                <h4>Structure of the Judiciary</h4>
                <p>The judiciary in Bangladesh is structured hierarchically, with the Supreme Court at the apex. The Supreme Court comprises the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, each playing a crucial role in the administration of justice. The Appellate Division hears appeals from the High Court Division and has the final say in interpreting the constitution and laws of the country. The High Court Division has original and appellate jurisdiction, hearing appeals from lower courts and exercising supervisory powers over them.</p>
                <h4>Role of District Courts</h4>
                <p>District courts play a vital role in the legal landscape of Bangladesh. They are the first point of contact for most legal disputes, handling a wide range of civil and criminal cases. Civil cases include property disputes, contractual disagreements, and family law matters such as divorce and child custody. Criminal cases encompass a broad spectrum, from minor offenses to serious crimes like murder and robbery.</p>

                <h4>Access to Justice</h4>
                <p>Access to justice is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution of Bangladesh. However, ensuring that all citizens can access legal services remains a significant challenge. Barriers to access include financial constraints, lack of awareness about legal rights, and geographical limitations. Many individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, struggle to navigate the complex legal system and obtain the help they need.</p>
                <h4>Role of Legal Professionals</h4>
                <p>Legal professionals play a crucial role in ensuring access to justice. Lawyers provide essential legal advice, representation, and advocacy for clients, helping them navigate the legal system and protect their rights. Legal aid organizations offer free or low-cost legal services to those who cannot afford private representation, ensuring that everyone has access to justice regardless of their financial circumstances.</p>
                <h4>The Need for Legal Services</h4>
                <p>Legal services are essential for both individual citizens and the functioning of the judicial system. For individuals, legal services provide the means to protect their rights, resolve disputes, and obtain justice. Whether facing a property dispute, a criminal charge, or a family law matter, access to legal services ensures that individuals can navigate the legal system and achieve a fair outcome.</p>
